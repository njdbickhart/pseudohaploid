Running the simple example
===============================================================
Generating pseudohaploid genome sequence
----------------------------------------
GENOME: simple.fa
OUTPREFIX: ph.simple
MIN_IDENTITY: 90
MIN_LENGTH: 1000
MIN_CONTAIN: 93
MAX_CHAIN_GAP: 20000

1. Aligning simple.fa to itself with nucmer
Original assembly has 2 contigs

2. Filter for alignments longer than 1000 bp and below 90 identity

3. Generating coords file

4. Identifying alignment chains: min_id: 90 min_contain: 93 max_gap: 20000
Processing coords file (ph.simple.filter.coords)...
Processed 6 alignment records [4 valid]
Finding chains for 2 contigs...
Found 2 total edges [0.000 constructtime, 0.000 searchtime, 4 stackadd]
Looking for contained contigs...
Found 1 joint contained contigs
Printed 1 total contained contigs

5. Generating a list of redundant contig ids using min_contain: 93
Identified 1 redundant contig to remove in ph.simple.contained.ids

6. Creating final pseudohaploid assembly in ph.simple.pseudohap.fa
Pseudohaploid assembly has 1 contigs

This should report: Pseudohaploid assembly has 1 contigs

GENOME: basic.fa
OUTPREFIX: ph.basic
MIN_IDENTITY: 90
